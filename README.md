## Homage to the Square

Inspired by a rainy Sunday at the Harvard Art Museum.

["The series is defined by an unmitigating adherence to one pictorial formula: the square."](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/173).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
